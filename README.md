 Microservice Demo 
 
This project demonstrates how to set up a complete CI/CD pipeline using Azure services for containerized applications.

Key Features:
The application is dockerized and pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
It is hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalability and reliability.
A CI/CD pipeline is configured using Azure Pipelines, automating the build, testing, and deployment process.

Workflow:
Dockerization: The microservice was containerized using Docker, enabling consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
Azure Container Registry (ACR): The Docker image was pushed to Azure Container Registry, providing a secure and scalable repository for the container image.
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): The application is hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service, ensuring high availability and dynamic scaling.
CI/CD Pipeline: Azure Pipelines was configured to automate the build, test, and deployment stages, streamlining the development workflow.
This project serves as an example of how to efficiently build, deploy, and manage microservices in a cloud environment using Azure.
